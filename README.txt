# Site Package (Clean)

This package contains:
- home.html (public homepage, with QR placeholder)
- product-catalog.html, banquet.html, order.html (neutralized, links updated)
- index.html (private hub; not indexed)
- assets/ (CSS/JS/IMG as provided)

**What changed:**
- Removed Supreme/Linda specific folders
- Neutralized titles/meta (no Grand/Supreme/PA/years in code)
- Shared header/footer kept from your design
- Added QR placeholder block to home.html

**Next steps:**
- Deploy to Vercel, then swap /assets/img/qr-placeholder.svg with a real QR for your final URL.
